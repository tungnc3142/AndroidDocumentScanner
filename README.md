[![](https://jitpack.io/v/meganz/AndroidDocumentScanner.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#meganz/AndroidDocumentScanner)


This library helps you to scan any document like CamScanner.

## Download

Step 1. Add it in your root `build.gradle` at the end of repositories:

	allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
	}

Step 2. Add the dependency

	dependencies {
	        implementation 'com.github.meganz:AndroidDocumentScanner:TAG'
	}


## How to use

Call `DocumentScannerActivity` like following:

        Intent intent = DocumentScannerActivity.getIntent(this);
        startActivityForResult(intent, REQUEST_CODE_SCAN_DOCUMENT);

Get the result document on `onActivityResult()`:

        if (requestCode == REQUEST_CODE_SCAN_DOCUMENT) {
            if (resultCode == RESULT_OK) {
                Uri fileUri = intent.getData();
                String fileMimeType = intent.getType();

                // do something
            }
        }

Add the Activity to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:


        <activity
            android:name="nz.mega.documentscanner.DocumentScannerActivity"
            android:launchMode="singleTop"
            android:screenOrientation="sensorPortrait"
            android:theme="@style/DocumentScannerTheme"
            android:windowSoftInputMode="stateHidden|adjustNothing"/>

You can set a custom `android:theme` to override the default one.
